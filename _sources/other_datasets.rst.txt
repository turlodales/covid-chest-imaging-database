PHOSP-COVID
-----------

The `Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID) <https://www.phosp.org/>`_ is collaborating with the
National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database (NCCID). PHOSP-COVID is a national
consortium, led by experts at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust
under the umbrella of the NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre. It aims
to understand and improve long-term health outcomes for patients who have been
discharged from hospital with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.

PHOSP-COVID has been set up and funded as a long term research study to recruit
10,000 patients who have been hospitalised with COVID-19. Over the course of a
year, clinical assessments will track patients to gain a comprehensive picture
of the impact COVID-19 has had on longer term health outcomes across the UK.

PHOSP-COVID will be collecting samples and scans for patients from a network of
Trusts in the UK (see `here <https://www.phosp.org/network/institution-trust/>`__ for the full list).

PHOSP-COVID is collaborating with the NCCID initiative to ensure that the same
sites included in the PHOSP-COVID network are also contributing towards the
NCCID database. This is so that PHOSP-COVID researchers are able to access
important data already collected for patients via the NCCID study in order
to accompany the longitudinal data PHOSP-COVID are collecting for patients.

.. note::
    **Important information for data collection sites** |br|
    If you are contacted by the PHOSP-COVID study to upload data but are
    not yet contributing to the NCCID, we would ask that you follow the
    instructions :ref:`here <data collection>` to ensure you are contributing
    to both studies.


ISARIC
------

The `International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium <https://isaric.org/>`_ (ISARIC) was founded in 2011 to prevent illness and deaths from infectious disease outbreaks. It is a global federation of clinical research networks, providing a proficient, coordinated and agile research response to outbreak-prone infectious disease.

This consortium is responding to the current COVID-19 outbreak by creating tools for investigators to collect and store data in a standardised way and has supported clinical trials of treatments. One of these tools, the ‘Clinical Characterisation Protocol‘ (CCP), has been co-developed by HDR UK members, in consultation with colleagues at the World Health Organisation.

The CCP sets out how data and biological samples from patients with COVID-19 should be collected, regardless of where in the world they are. It’s the product of many years of discussion among international investigators from a wide range of scientific and medical disciplines. Work to develop this protocol started in response to Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012-2013, Influenza H7N9 in 2013, viral haemorrhagic fever (Ebolavirus) in 2014, Monkeypox & MERS-CoV in 2018 and Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in 2019. It is now being used for COVID-19 .

ISARIC-4C will augment the aforementioned datasets, which have played a central role in the UK’s research response to COVID-19, with imaging data from the NCCID. This will support improvements in the understanding, diagnosis and prognosis of the disease through the availability of data that comprises a wide range of variables such as clinical measurements, ‘omics’ assays, and radiology scans.
